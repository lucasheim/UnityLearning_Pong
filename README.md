# Solo Pong

This is my first project on learning Unity, inspired by a tutorial on [CatLikeCoding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/prototypes/paddle-square/). The code here is NOT following the tutorial, but rather trying to implement the same functionality without going through the step-by-step, for an active learning experience.

I intend to revisit it in the future as I learn more, but for now I'm happy to have something in a playable state.
